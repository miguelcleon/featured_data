### Description

This data package represents one of the long-term, continuous data sets in the EDI data repository and contains weekly water quality data from several streams in the 
[Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luquillo_Experimental_Forest) (Figure 1). LEF, a protected area of tropical rainforest in the Luquillo Mountains within in Puerto Rico's El Yunque National Forest, was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976, with the goal to enhance understanding of long-term dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems.


In 1988 the [Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research Project (LUQ)](https://luquillo.lter.network/) was established as one of 26 sites of the NSF funded [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), to study the long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in LEF.

Stream water sampling in LEF began in 1983. Weekly water chemistry sampling started in 1988 at 13 sites along the El Verde, Bisley and other streams. All water samples are measured for pH, conductivity, NH4 and NO3. A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at all ongoing stream sampling sites, while average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) in LEF. From 1994 on all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire.

### Studies using the data and results

Since the founding of the first Tropical Forest Research Station in the Luquillo Mountains in 1940, hundreds of research studies have been carried out at this center for ecosystem research. Research papers on catchment science in the montane tropic using the stream data featured here, encompass a large variety of topics, including how a changing climate and disturbance regimes (i.e. hurricanes, landslides, alterations in agricultural practice) alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes but also highlight the resilience of the ecosystem.

A paper by McDowell et al. (2021) on the "Luquillo Experimental Forest: Catchment science in the montane tropics" highlights the importance of several LEF data sets that provide some of the longest available records of biogeochemical fluxes in tropical forests. The data were used to document and understand montane tropical watersheds in the context of disturbance and global environmental change, specifically the effects of major hurricanes including Hugo (1989), Georges (1998) and Maria (2017) on LEF vegetation, biota and catchment biogeochemistry. Findings show ...

Another study by Mariani-Ríos et al. (2022) investigated the natural history of Odonate species assemblages (dragonflies and damselflies) in headwater montane streams following major hurricane impacts in Puerto Rico (Fig. 3). Odonates are important freshwater macroinvertebrate predators that play an important role in maintaining stream food webs and serve as indicators of stream health. The authors found negative relations between species abundance and stream discharge, canopy cover, water temperature, and rainfall, none was statistically significant and the results suggest a lack of strong temporal seasonality in the natural history of Odonata, which coincides with the aseasonal environment of streams draining in the study area.

Two more studies are concerned with the influence of critical zone processes. 
The first study investigated the effects of critical zone processes on Magnesium concentrations and isotopic signatures of tropical streams in a well constrained, highly weathered andesitic volcaniclastic catchment in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory. The study highlights the importance of atmospheric input of nutrients to the vegetation in tropical areas covered by thick, highly leached regolith, whereas the Mg flux and Mg isotopic signature of watershed exports are dominated by bedrock dissolution delivered to the stream through deeper, usually un-sampled critical zone pathways.


Incipient chemical weathering at bedrock fracture interfaces in a tropical critical zone system, Puerto Rico

The processes that control chemical weathering of bedrock in the deep critical zone at a mm-scale are still poorly understood, but may produce 100 s of meters of regolith and substantial fluxes of silicate weathering products and thus may be important for modeling long-term, global CO2. 

Weathering controls are also difficult to ascertain, as laboratory determined dissolution rates tend to be 2–5 orders of magnitude faster than field determined dissolution rates. 

This study aims to establish (i) the incipient processes that control the chemical weathering of the Bisley bedrock and (ii) why weathering rates calculated for the watershed may differ from laboratory rates (iii) why rates may differ across different scales of measurement. We analyzed mineralogy, elemental chemistry, and porosity in thin sections of rock obtained from drilled boreholes using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry, electron probe microanalysis, and synchrotron-based Micro X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). Weathering ages were determined from U-series isotope analysis. Mineral specific dissolution rates were calculated from solid-state mineralogical gradients and weathering ages. Mineralogical and elemental transects across thin sections and SEM images indicate that trace pyrite is the first mineral to dissolve. Micro-XRF mapping at 2 µm resolution revealed sulfate in pore space adjacent to dissolving pyrite, indicating that the incipient reaction is oxidative. The oxidative dissolution of pyrite produces a low pH microenvironment that aids the dissolution of pyroxene and chlorite. The rate-limiting step of weathering advance, and therefore the creation of the critical zone in the Bisley watershed, is pyrite oxidation, despite the low abundance (∼0.5 vol%) of pyrite in the parent rock. The naturally determined dissolution rates presented here either approach, converge with, or in some cases exceed, rates from the literature that have been experimentally determined. The U-series weathering age data on the mm-scale integrates the weathering advance rate over the ∼4.2 ± 0.3 kyrs that the weathering rind took to form. The weathering advance rate calculated at a watershed scale (from stream chemistry data) represents a contemporary weathering advance rate, which compares well with that calculated for the weathering rind, suggesting that the Bisley watershed has been weathering at steady-state for the last ∼4 kyrs.
