### Description

This data package represents one of the long-term, continuous data sets in the EDI data repository and contains weekly water quality data from several streams in the 
[Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luquillo_Experimental_Forest) (Figure 1). LEF, a protected area of tropical rainforest in the Luquillo Mountains within in Puerto Rico's El Yunque National Forest, was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976, with the goal to enhance understanding of long-term dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems.


In 1988 the [Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research Project (LUQ)](https://luquillo.lter.network/) was established as one of 26 sites of the NSF funded [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), to study the long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in LEF.

Stream water sampling in LEF began in 1983. Weekly water chemistry sampling started in 1988 at 13 sites along the El Verde, Bisley and other streams. All water samples are measured for pH, conductivity, NH4 and NO3. A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at all ongoing stream sampling sites, while average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) in LEF. From 1994 on all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire.

### Studies using the data and results

Since the founding of the first Tropical Forest Research Station in the Luquillo Mountains in 1940, hundreds of research studies have been carried out at this center for ecosystem research. Research papers on catchment science in the montane tropic using the stream data featured here, encompass a large variety of topics, including how a changing climate and disturbance regimes (i.e. hurricanes, landslides, alterations in agricultural practice) alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes but also highlight the resilience of the ecosystem. Here we list publications and summarize their outcome that are added to the data package landing page.

A paper by McDowell et al. (2021) on the "Luquillo Experimental Forest: Catchment science in the montane tropics" highlights the importance of several LEF data sets that provide some of the longest available records of biogeochemical fluxes in tropical forests. The data were used to document and understand montane tropical watersheds in the context of disturbance and global environmental change, specifically the effects of major hurricanes including Hugo (1989), Georges (1998) and Maria (2017) on LEF vegetation, biota and catchment biogeochemistry. Findings show ...

A recent study by Mariani-Ríos et al. (2022) investigated the natural history of Odonate species assemblages (dragonflies and damselflies) in headwater montane streams following major hurricane impacts in Puerto Rico (Fig. 3). Odonates are important freshwater macroinvertebrate predators that play an important role in maintaining stream food webs and serve as indicators of stream health. The authors found negative relations between species abundance and stream discharge, canopy cover, water temperature, and rainfall, none was statistically significant and the results suggest a lack of strong temporal seasonality in the natural history of Odonata, which coincides with the aseasonal environment of streams draining in the study area.

Chapela et al. (2017) are concerned with the influence of critical zone processes on Magnesium concentrations and isotopic signatures of tropical streams in the well constrained, highly weathered andesitic volcaniclastic NAME catchment in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory. The study highlights the importance of atmospheric input of nutrients to the vegetation in tropical areas covered by thick, highly leached regolith, whereas the Magnesium flux and Magnesium isotopic signature of watershed exports are dominated by bedrock dissolution delivered to the stream through deeper, usually un-sampled critical zone pathways.

Moore et al. (2019) studied incipient chemical weathering at bedrock fracture interfaces, a process that is not yet well understood, but might affect long-term, global carbon dioxide concentrations by producing substantial fluxes of silicate weathering products. The study was carried out on thin sections of rock obtained from the Bisley bedrock, a part of LEF's critical zone system. Mineralogy, elemental chemistry, porosity and weathering agesof the rock were analyzed using a number of methods such as Scanning Electron Microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry, electron probe microanalysis, and others. Mineral specific dissolution rates were calculated from solid-state mineralogical gradients and weathering ages. The weathering advance rate calculated at a watershed scale (from stream chemistry data) represents a contemporary weathering advance rate, which compares well with that calculated for the weathering rind, suggesting that the Bisley watershed has been weathering at steady-state for the last ∼4 kyrs.
