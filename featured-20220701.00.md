### Description

This data package contains weekly water quality data from several streams in the Luquillo Mountains in Puerto Rico and represents one of EDI's long-term, continuous data sets. Stream water sampling began in 1983, with the [Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research Project](https://luquillo.lter.network/) taking on sampling in 1988, after entering the LTER program. Puerto Ricoâ€™s Luquillo site (LUQ) was established to study the long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Figure 1).

Stream water samples are grab samples taken from the water/air interface at stream channel center on the sampling day (usually Tuesdays). 

A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at all ongoing stream sampling sites, while average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) on this site. 
All samples are measured for pH, conductivity, NH4 and NO3. From 1994 on, samples for NH4 and NO3 were frozen until analysis, and all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire.

In this article explore:

- Why this data set is special
- Relation to critical zone
- Type of papers based on these data
