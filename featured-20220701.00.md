### Description

This data package represents one of the long-term, continuous data sets in the EDI data repository and contains weekly water quality data from several streams in the 
Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico. LEF, a protected area of tropical rainforest in the Luquillo Mountains within El Yunque National Forest, was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976, with the goal to enhance understanding of long-term dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems. 

In 1988 the [Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research Project (LUQ)](https://luquillo.lter.network/) was established as one of 26 sites of the NSF funded Long Term Ecological Research Network, to study the long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in LEF (Figure 1).

Stream water sampling in LEF began in 1983. Weekly water chemistry sampling started in 1988 at 13 sites along the El Verde stream, Bisley and other streams. All water samples are measured for pH, conductivity, NH4 and NO3. A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at all ongoing stream sampling sites, while average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) in LEF. From 1994 on all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire.

Luquillo Experimental Forest: Catchment science in the montane tropics

Catchments in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico are warm, wet and tropical with steep elevational relief creating gradients in temperature and rainfall. Long-term objectives of research at the site are to understand how changing climate and disturbance regimes alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the montane tropics and to provide information critical for managing and conserving tropical forest ecosystems globally. Measurements of hydrology and meteorology span decades, and currently include temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud base level, throughfall, groundwater table elevation and stream discharge. The chemistry of rain, throughfall, and streams is measured weekly and lysimeters and wells are sampled monthly to quarterly. Multiple data sets document the effects of major hurricanes including Hugo (1989), Georges (1998) and Maria (2017) on vegetation, biota and catchment biogeochemistry and provide some of the longest available records of biogeochemical fluxes in tropical forests. Here we present an overview of the findings and the data sets that have been generated from the LEF, highlighting their importance for understanding montane tropical watersheds in the context of disturbance and global environmental change.


The influence of critical zone processes on the Mg isotope budget in a tropical, highly weathered andesitic catchment

In order to assess the effects of critical zone processes on Mg concentrations and isotopic signatures of tropical streams, we studied a well constrained, highly weathered andesitic volcaniclastic catchment in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico. Our results indicate that dissolved Mg concentrations and isotope ratios in the regolith pore water are mainly controlled by rain input, with weathering inputs being more important at sites with thinner regolith (2.7–0.9 m deep) and at depth (>8 m) on a thick ridgetop regolith (∼10 m). In addition to mixing of precipitation and weathering-sourced Mg, an isotopic fractionation process is taking place between dissolved Mg and the regolith, likely during dissolution or recrystallisation of Fe(III)-(hydro)oxides under alternating redox conditions. Bulk regolith is isotopically heavier than both the bedrock and the exchangeable fraction (δ26Mgregolith-bedrock = +0.03 to +0.47‰), consistent with the preferential incorporation of heavy 26Mg into secondary minerals with some exchange of sorbed Mg with isotopically lighter pore water. Magnesium concentrations in the stream show a typical dilution behaviour during a storm event, but the [Mg] – δ26Mg pattern cannot be explained by mixing of rain and pore water; the data are best explained by a steady-state fractionation model with α = 1.00115. During baseflow the stream has δ26Mg = +0.01‰, higher than any of the water samples or the bedrock. In-situ analysis of the Mg isotopic composition of bedrock minerals points at the dissolution of Mg-rich chlorite (δ26Mg = +0.19‰) as the most likely source of this isotopically heavy Mg, with mass balance calculations indicating chlorite dissolution is also the main source of Mg to the stream. Overall, our study highlights the importance of atmospheric input of nutrients to the vegetation in tropical areas covered by thick, highly leached regolith, whereas the Mg flux and Mg isotopic signature of watershed exports are dominated by bedrock dissolution delivered to the stream through deeper, usually un-sampled critical zone pathways.


Incipient chemical weathering at bedrock fracture interfaces in a tropical critical zone system, Puerto Rico


The processes that control chemical weathering of bedrock in the deep critical zone at a mm-scale are still poorly understood, but may produce 100 s of meters of regolith and substantial fluxes of silicate weathering products and thus may be important for modeling long-term, global CO2. Weathering controls are also difficult to ascertain, as laboratory determined dissolution rates tend to be 2–5 orders of magnitude faster than field determined dissolution rates. This study aims to establish (i) the incipient processes that control the chemical weathering of the Bisley bedrock and (ii) why weathering rates calculated for the watershed may differ from laboratory rates (iii) why rates may differ across different scales of measurement. We analyzed mineralogy, elemental chemistry, and porosity in thin sections of rock obtained from drilled boreholes using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry, electron probe microanalysis, and synchrotron-based Micro X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). Weathering ages were determined from U-series isotope analysis. Mineral specific dissolution rates were calculated from solid-state mineralogical gradients and weathering ages. Mineralogical and elemental transects across thin sections and SEM images indicate that trace pyrite is the first mineral to dissolve. Micro-XRF mapping at 2 µm resolution revealed sulfate in pore space adjacent to dissolving pyrite, indicating that the incipient reaction is oxidative. The oxidative dissolution of pyrite produces a low pH microenvironment that aids the dissolution of pyroxene and chlorite. The rate-limiting step of weathering advance, and therefore the creation of the critical zone in the Bisley watershed, is pyrite oxidation, despite the low abundance (∼0.5 vol%) of pyrite in the parent rock. The naturally determined dissolution rates presented here either approach, converge with, or in some cases exceed, rates from the literature that have been experimentally determined. The U-series weathering age data on the mm-scale integrates the weathering advance rate over the ∼4.2 ± 0.3 kyrs that the weathering rind took to form. The weathering advance rate calculated at a watershed scale (from stream chemistry data) represents a contemporary weathering advance rate, which compares well with that calculated for the weathering rind, suggesting that the Bisley watershed has been weathering at steady-state for the last ∼4 kyrs.


Natural history of Odonata assemblages in tropical streams in Puerto Rico


Freshwater macroinvertebrates play an important role in maintaining stream food webs. Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are important top predators in these communities and serve as indicators of stream health. Our understanding of odonate assemblages is limited in the Caribbean and the natural history of most odonate species in the region remains unknown. The focus of this research is to study the natural history of odonate species in headwater montane streams following major hurricane impacts in Puerto Rico. We monitored assemblages from August 2018 to July 2019 in two headwater streams within El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. The study streams drain a protected forest, with aseasonal precipitation patterns, relatively constant water temperature, and flashy hydrographs that quickly respond to rain events. We sampled 226 adults and 550 larvae, dominated by three Caribbean endemics: Scapanea frontalis, Macrothemis celeno, and Telebasis vulnerata. Only S. frontalis and M. celeno were abundant enough to assess the temporal patterns and their natural history. Larval density fluctuated throughout the year with short peaks in abundance during different times of the year, according to the species. Small individuals (≤10 mm body length) were more abundant than the large ones. However, all size classes were present during the year. The dominant species, S. frontalis and M. celeno, had continuous development patterns, without identifiable size classes and multiple overlapping generations. The exception was the last stadium that formed a separate group in the body length vs head width plots. Species had clear habitat preferences; S. frontalis was abundant in riffles and preferred areas with high amounts of cobble. Macrothemis celeno prefers pool habitats with fine substrates. While we found trends for negative relations between abundance and discharge, canopy cover, water temperature, and rainfall, none was statistically significant. Observed patterns suggest a lack of strong temporal seasonality in the natural history of Odonata, which coincides with the aseasonal environment of streams draining our study area. Overall, our study is the first to assess temporal variability of Odonata assemblages in montane streams of Puerto Rico and provides information on Caribbean endemic species.
